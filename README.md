RCD 5.0 — Formal Research Framework

This repository contains the complete formal structure of RCD 5.0, a geometric modification of General Relativity based on axioms, reproducibility, and explicit computational logs.

The package includes six self-contained documents:

Core Theory — axiom set, operators, and geometric structure.

Field Geometry — causal density, torsional saturation, and metric corrections.

Spacetime Dynamics — temporal antisymmetry, evolution operators, and stability checks.

Glossary — mapping between RCD terminology and accepted dark-matter observational facts.

Technical Appendices — derivations, proofs, and arithmetic logs following the Absolute Rule.

Formal Rigor Framework — the verification architecture (Rule of Four + Absolute Rule).

Reproducibility

RCD 5.0 follows two strict principles:

Rule of Four — every claim must be supported by four independent layers:
mathematical derivation, numerical evidence, physical consistency, and boundary-condition verification.

Absolute Rule — all computations must be explicitly logged; every constant, equation, and numerical step must be independently verifiable via SHA-256 digests.

Contents

All documents are available under /docs.

Future additions:

/code — numerical pipelines for rotation-curve tests and cosmological checks

/data — curated datasets (SPARC, Kepler EBCatalog)

/logs — SHA-256 digests and full arithmetic logs
